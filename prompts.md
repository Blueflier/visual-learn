**quality check**
run `npm run test && npm run debug && npm run lint` 
and fix errors until all tests work, no errors, and no linters

**building new features**
1. Come up with a plan that accounts for the existing codebase as to not rewrite code or create conflicting code.
2. Build the tests for the features in `@src/tests` but DO NOT generate tests that render components
3. Follow task outline to build the feature
